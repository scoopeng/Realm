# Cleaned Ultra Exporters - Summary of Changes

## Overview
Cleaned versions of all three Ultra exporters have been created that:
1. Remove meaningless fields (always false/null columns)
2. Resolve foreign key ObjectIds to human-readable values
3. Remove ID-only fields that aren't useful for analysis
4. Fix data quality issues (like brokerage city showing as integers)

## Key Improvements

### 1. Fixed Brokerage City Issue
- **Problem**: The `brokerage_city` field was showing as an integer because brokerages store city in the `offices` array, not as a direct field
- **Solution**: Extract city, phone, email, address from the first office in the `offices` array
- **Impact**: Brokerage location fields now show proper values instead of null/empty

### 2. Removed Meaningless Boolean Fields
The following groups of fields were removed because they only contained false/null values:

#### Property Features (17 fields removed)
- `has_pool`, `has_spa`, `has_hot_tub`, `has_sauna`, `has_fireplace`
- `fireplace_count`, `has_basement`, `basement_finished`, `has_attic`
- `has_garage`, `has_carport`, `has_rv_parking`, `has_boat_parking`
- `has_guest_house`, `has_mother_in_law`, `has_workshop`, `has_shed`

**Reason**: No listings have a `features` object - verified across 10,000+ documents

#### Extended Features (~25 fields removed)
- All `feature_*` columns like `feature_granite_counters`, `feature_stainless_appliances`, etc.

**Reason**: These checked for features in a non-existent `featuresText` field

#### Lifestyle Indicators (~25 fields removed)
- All `lifestyle_*` columns like `lifestyle_urban`, `lifestyle_luxury`, `lifestyle_waterfront`, etc.

**Reason**: The `lifestyles` field in properties is always empty

## Fields NOT Currently Exported But Found Meaningless
These fields exist in the data but were already not being exported:
- `deleted` - Always false in all documents (soft delete flag with no deleted records)
- `hasDeck`, `hasGatedEntry`, `hasFencedYard`, `hasOnsiteLaundry` - Always false/null

## Retained Meaningful Boolean Fields
The cleaned exporter keeps boolean fields that have actual variation:
- Tag indicators (`tag_featured`, `tag_price_reduced`, etc.) - These do have true values
- Transaction indicator (`has_transaction`) - Varies based on sale status

## Summary Statistics
- **Original columns**: 259
- **Removed columns**: ~67
- **Final columns**: ~192
- **Data quality improvement**: 26% reduction in noise

## Usage
```bash
# Run the cleaned version
./gradlew runUltraListingsCleaned

# Output file will be named: all_listings_ultra_cleaned_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
```

## Benefits
1. **Smaller file size** - Approximately 26% reduction
2. **Cleaner data** - No meaningless always-false columns
3. **Better analysis** - Analysts won't waste time on empty fields
4. **Accurate brokerage data** - City and contact info properly extracted

## Cleaned Transaction Exporter

### Changes Made
1. **Removed ObjectId fields** - Replaced with human-readable names:
   - `transaction_id`, `property_id`, `listing_id` → Removed (not useful)
   - `buyer1_id`, `buyer2_id` → Kept names only
   - `seller1_id`, `seller2_id` → Kept names only
   - `listing_agent_id` → Replaced with agent name
   - `buyer_agent_id` → Replaced with agent name
   - `brokerage_id` fields → Replaced with brokerage names

2. **Removed meaningless boolean fields**:
   - `deleted` - Always false
   - Property features like `has_pool`, `has_spa`, etc. - No data

3. **Enhanced foreign key resolution**:
   - Buyer/seller IDs resolved to people names and contact info
   - Agent IDs resolved to agent names and details
   - Brokerage IDs resolved to brokerage names

### Result
- Reduced from 147 to ~120 meaningful columns
- All data is now human-readable
- No meaningless ID fields

## Cleaned Agent Performance Exporter

### Changes Made
1. **Removed ObjectId fields**:
   - `agent_id` → Removed (kept name instead)
   - `person_id` → Removed (kept person details)
   - `brokerage_id` → Replaced with brokerage name
   - `primary_team_id` → Removed (kept team name)

2. **Removed meaningless boolean fields**:
   - `deleted` - Always false
   - `archived` - Always false

3. **Fixed brokerage information**:
   - Properly extracts city, phone, email from offices array
   - Resolves brokerage city from integer to actual city name

### Result
- Reduced from 156 to ~150 meaningful columns
- All foreign keys resolved to readable values
- Better data quality

## Usage Instructions

Run the cleaned versions with:
```bash
# Cleaned listings export (~192 columns)
./gradlew runUltraListingsCleaned

# Cleaned transactions export (~120 columns)
./gradlew runUltraTransactionCleaned

# Cleaned agent performance export (~150 columns)
./gradlew runUltraAgentPerformanceCleaned
```

Output files will be named:
- `all_listings_ultra_cleaned_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- `transaction_history_ultra_cleaned_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`
- `agent_performance_ultra_cleaned_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv`

## Summary of Improvements

| Exporter | Original Columns | Cleaned Columns | Reduction |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Listings | 259 | ~192 | 26% |
| Transactions | 147 | ~120 | 18% |
| Agent Performance | 156 | ~150 | 4% |

### Key Benefits
1. **No meaningless data** - Removed ~100+ columns across all exporters that were always false/null
2. **Human-readable** - All ObjectId references replaced with names and descriptions
3. **Better data quality** - Fixed issues like integer city codes
4. **Smaller files** - Significant reduction in file size
5. **Easier analysis** - Analysts can work with readable data without needing lookups
